# Task 2: NBA Player Performance (Regression Analysis)

## Key Features and Their Importance
1. **Points per Game**: Most predictive of game score.
2. **Rebounds per Game**: Moderately influential.
3. **Assists per Game**: Minor contribution to overall performance.

## Model Performance
- **Linear Regression**:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.75
  - R-squared: 0.87
- **Ridge Regression**:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.65
  - R-squared: 0.89

## Insights
- Ridge Regression outperformed Linear Regression by reducing overfitting.
- Derived features (e.g., performance per game) significantly improved model accuracy.
- Adding new features like minutes played could further enhance predictions.
